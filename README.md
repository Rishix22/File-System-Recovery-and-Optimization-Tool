**File System Recovery and Optimization Tool**

## Overview
The **File System Recovery and Optimization Tool** is a simple yet powerful Python-based utility that simulates a basic file system. It provides functionalities for file creation, deletion, reading, defragmentation, and backup/restore operations, aiming to improve efficiency and data integrity.

## Features
- **File Creation**: Create files with dynamically allocated storage blocks.
- **File Reading**: Retrieve and display file contents efficiently.
- **File Deletion**: Remove files and free up allocated storage blocks.
- **Defragmentation**: Optimize storage by reorganizing file allocations to minimize fragmentation.
- **Backup System**: Save the current file system state for future recovery.
- **Restore System**: Restore the file system from a saved backup state.
- **Block Allocation Management**: Efficiently manage allocation and deallocation of storage blocks.
- **Simulated Disk Storage**: Emulates a real-world file system structure.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies required

### Running the Tool
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rishix22/File-System-Recovery-and-Optimization-Tool.git
   cd File-System-Recovery-and-Optimization-Tool
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python file_system.py
   ```

### Example Usage
```python
fs = FileSystem()
fs.create_file("file1", "hello")
fs.create_file("file2", "world")
fs.read_file("file1")
fs.defragment()
fs.backup_system()
fs.restore_system()
fs.read_file("file2")
```

## How It Works
- **File Creation**: Identifies and assigns available storage blocks to new files.
- **File Reading**: Accesses and retrieves file content from allocated blocks.
- **File Deletion**: Frees occupied blocks, making them available for future use.
- **Defragmentation**: Reorganizes file allocations to enhance read/write efficiency and prevent fragmentation.
- **Backup & Restore**: Uses serialization to store and recover file system states, ensuring data safety.
- **Logging**: Tracks operations and errors, aiding debugging and monitoring.
